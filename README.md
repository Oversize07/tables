# Tables
Manage to print on the screen a stylized table.

# Data Structure
The idea is to use a pointer to a structure wich contains a vector (wich represent columns of the table) of matrix of strings (representing the fields of a single row in a table)
plus other infos like how many records there are, how many numbers there are, the number of characters in the table.
